What is Simon Says?
Simon Says is a classic memory-based game where players must recall and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts with a single color being displayed. With each successful round, a new color is added to the sequence, increasing the difficulty.

The goal is to correctly repeat the entire sequence for as long as possible without making a mistake.
